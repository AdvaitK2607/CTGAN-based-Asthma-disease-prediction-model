CTGAN-Based Asthma Disease Prediction Model
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that requires early and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. This project leverages CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN) to generate high-quality synthetic medical data, improving model training and prediction accuracy.

Key Features:

Dataset Source: The dataset is sourced from the research paper "A Comprehensive Study on the Applications of Artificial Intelligence for the Medical Diagnosis and Prognosis of Asthma" by Saksham Kukreja.
CTGAN for Data Augmentation: Overcomes data scarcity by generating realistic synthetic patient records.
Machine Learning Models: Implements ANN (Artificial Neural Network), DNN (Deep Neural Network), and Random Forest for asthma risk classification.
High Prediction Accuracy: Achieves a maximum accuracy of 98%.
Robust Performance Metrics: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.
